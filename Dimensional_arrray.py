# 0-D arrays
# 0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.
import numpy as np

# 1-D array
# An array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array.
arr=np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
print(arr)

# 2-D array 
arr2=np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]])
print(arr2)

# 3-D array
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])
